Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

## 什么是Moonbit


## Why Moonbit

MoonBit's ability for rapid static analysis is designed with triple security measures.

### A secure type system
Through structured interfaces and the type system, MoonBit allows large models to more accurately recognize patterns and structures in code, thereby generating more accurate and efficient code. This design not only improves the quality of generated code but also facilitates maintenance and expansion of code in the future.

### Sandboxing security technique
Designed as a language for WebAssembly, MoonBit utilizes WebAssembly-based sandboxing security techniques to isolate execution environments, protecting the development process and final products from malicious code and attacks.

### Dead code elimination
MoonBit links high-level IR files together using a linker and optimizes the overall structure, effectively eliminating dead code and omitting language features that hinder the analysis to significantly reduce the size of the final code. The triple security measures provide assurance for maintaining code security and improving code accuracy.
